		<h2 id="alderman">What is an Alderman?</h2>
	
		<p>An alderman is a member of a municipal assembly or council in many jurisdictions founded upon English law. The term maybe titular, denoting a high-ranking member of a borough or county council, a council member chosen by the elected members themselves rather than by popular vote, or a council member elected by voters.</p>

		<p>The title is derived from the Old English title of ealdorman, literally meaning "elder man", and was used by the chief nobles presiding over shires.</p>

		<p>"Board of Aldermen" is the governing executive or legislative body of many cities and towns in the United States. The term is sometimes used instead of city council, or is used of an executive board independent of the council, or is used of what amounts to an upper house of a bicameral legislature. Boards of Aldermen are used in many rural areas of the United States as opposed to a larger city council or city commission.</p>
